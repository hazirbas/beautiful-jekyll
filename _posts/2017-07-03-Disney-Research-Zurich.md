It has been quite a while until I found the time to write this post. However, I must mention the only factor why I did not write it during the internship was certainly that I enjoyed my visit to Zurich quite a lot and always procrastinated writing. This was not my first time in Zurich, I was there before with my parents and sister when they visited me for my graduation on December 2014. Nevertheless, this time I had more and less biased impressions about the city and its residents.
<br><br>
Let me start with Zurich. It is a smaller version of Munich. Just packed around the very tiny town-ish center and everywhere is accessible to elsewhere easily by walking or by tram. I had a very nice and hospital roommate who actually Skyped with me once and let me share her apartment, Sabrina.
<br><br>
It is multi-dimensional manifold what makes you happy in a city. Well, my happiness started with my central apartment. It was only twenty minutes to central station and twenty-three minutes to Disney office which is located right next to the river Limmat. So, as you can imagine I had a very nice morning and afternoon walks from home to work and vice versa. Disney Research is organized purely with research lab standards, at least the one in Zurich. Everyone is quite chilled and working on the projects, mostly chosen by themselves. This freedom in an industrial environment is important to keep good researchers. I really enjoyed my stay as there were so many students (interns, ETH students who write thesis,...). Swimming in the Limmat after a fat lunch in a Thai restaurant was our daily habit.
<br><br>
My team purely focus on the research project and therefore even after three months I had a chance to write up a paper as well as a patent application. I believe, this is very satisfying and motivating outcome of a short-time visit. I will keep this post quite short, however, feel free to contact me directly for any further discussions.
