Another Ph.D. cadidate at the Computer Vision Group, TUM under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers](https://vision.cs.tum.edu/members/cremers). My focus is on Deep Learning (CNNs, LSTMs) for computer vision tasks such as object recognition, semantic scene understanding, optical flow and depth from focus.

### deep visioner
I am in love with computer vision. I won't even mention deep learning! Therefore I am a deep "visioner" and love deep discussions, especially the ones take long hours in the night with a glass of wine, in philosophy, history and technology. Ancient civilisations such as Sumer, are my favorites.
