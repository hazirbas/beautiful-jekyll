**Deep Visioner**

Yet another phd @[«TU Munich CV-AI Group»](https://vision.cs.tum.edu/){:target="_blank"}, yet another deep learner for computer vision.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Long story short, I am from Ankara, Turkey. After completing my Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering at Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul, I did an internship at KIT, Karlsruhe and achieved my Masters Degree in Informatics from the TU Munich in 26th June 2018.
<br><br>
I m quite interested in computer vision since my bachelor and therefore I decided to pursue my doctoral studies also in computer vision but this time involving deep learning. Considering my deep interest in both topics, I call myself a "deep visioner”.
<br><br>
What I like is basically deep discussions in philosophy and history -mostly ancient civilisations- with a glass of wine.
