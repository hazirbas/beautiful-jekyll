Yet another phd @[«TU Munich CV Group»](https://vision.cs.tum.edu/){:target="_blank"}, yet another deep learner for computer vision.


**Deep Visioner**

<div style="text-align: justify">
Long story short, I am from Ankara, Turkey. I studied Computer Engineering Bachelors Degree at Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul and Computer Science Masters Degree at the TU Munich. Since my first lecture in bachelor, I am in love with computer vision and since the beginning of my Ph.D., with deep learning! Therefore I am a deep “visioner” and love deep discussions, especially the ones take long hours in the night with a glass of wine, in philosophy, history and technology. Ancient civilisations such as Sumer, are my favorites.
