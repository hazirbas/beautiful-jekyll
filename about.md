**Deep Visioner**

Deep Learning Engineer at [Apple, Inc.](apple.com) Previously, a PhD student @[«TU Munich CV-AI Group»](https://vision.cs.tum.edu/){:target="_blank"} and yet another deep learner for computer vision.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Long story short, I am from Ankara, Turkey. After receving my Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering at the Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul, I did an internship at the KIT, Karlsruhe and achieved my Masters Degree in Informatics from the TU Munich in June 2014. Right after, joined [Daniel Cremers](https://vision.cs.tum.edu/members/cremers) research group as a PhD candidate and submitted my thesis in 2019.
<br><br>
I am quite interested in computer vision since my bachelor and therefore I decided to pursue my doctoral studies also in computer vision but this time involving deep learning. Considering my deep interest in both topics, I call myself a "deep visioner”.
<br><br>
What I like is basically deep discussions in philosophy and history -mostly ancient civilisations- with a glass of wine.
