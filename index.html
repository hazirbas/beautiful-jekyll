Yet another Ph.D. cadidate at the <a href="https://vision.cs.tum.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Vision Group</a>, TUM under the supervision of <a href="https://vision.cs.tum.edu/members/cremers" target="_blank"> Professor Daniel Cremers</a>.
My focus is on Deep Learning (CNNs, LSTMs) for Computer Vision problems such as object recognition, semantic scene understanding, optical flow and depth from focus.

<b>Deep Visioner</b><p align="justify">
Long story short, I am from Ankara, Turkey. I studied Computer Engineering Bachelors Degree at Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul and Computer Science Masters Degree at the TUM, Munich. Since my first lecture in bachelor, I am in love with computer vision and since the beginning of my Ph.D., with deep learning! Therefore I am a deep “visioner” and love deep discussions, especially the ones take long hours in the night with a glass of wine, in philosophy, history and technology. Ancient civilisations such as Sumer, are my favorites.
