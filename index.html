<b>Deep Visioner</b>
<p align="justify">I am in love with computer vision. I won’t even mention deep learning! Therefore I am a deep “visioner” and love deep discussions, especially the ones take long hours in the night with a glass of wine, in philosophy, history and technology. Ancient civilisations such as Sumer, are my favorites.
